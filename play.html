                    The titular track of this album lives up to Wave to Earth's trademark of dreamy, soft rock sounds while simultaneously embracing musical experimentation. Set adrift by the gradual passage of time, its lyrics embody the true meaning of going with the flow by “playing with the Earth, you know / In this endless glow.” Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Kim further amplifies this message through a frenetic electric guitar solo that evokes a spirit of carefreeness and vigor, reflected in the buildup to “But no one cares about us / So, We just dance, we just dance.”
