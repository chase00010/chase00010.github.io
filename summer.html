                    Five songs, one being an introduction in “summer flows,” makes up this EP. “summer flows” sets the entire mood with the dual electric guitar melodies overlapping each other. It moves quickly into “ride” and feels like the setting sun providing the last bit of warmth before sitting around a fire at night. The track is named perfectly because it presents itself like a slow flow of waves at the shore. The mellow instrumentals are carried across each instrument with the vocals tapping into the same energy. Everything on “ride” is about the groove. You get drawn in through the bass drum, wrapped by the bass guitar, and hypnotized with the guitars.
