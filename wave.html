                    Wave 0.01 is a bit of a departure from the albums I usually write about, most notably because it's not electronic music. Instead, it's pretty classic indie bordering on indie rock, highly melodic and (for me) extremely satisfying. The drummer especially captures my attention in almost every single track.
