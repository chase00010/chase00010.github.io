                    The song "Pueblo" by Wave to Earth paints a picture of a desolate town, where the narrator is feeling trapped and hopeless. The lyrics suggest that the narrator has decided to leave the town but before doing so, he plans to burn all of his places and memories, indicating that he wants to start afresh.                 </div>
